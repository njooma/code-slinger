      <description>&lt;p&gt;So. Here we are. Another tech blog by another software engineer who thinks he has something to contribute to the world of software that&amp;rsquo;s thoroughly saturated by people much smarter than him. Maybe he thinks he&amp;rsquo;s funnier, wittier, a better writer. Maybe he realized that all of his commits were in private repos and he needs something outward facing to show for it. Or maybe he just thinks that because the domain &lt;a href=&#34;https://codeslinger.io&#34;&gt;https://codeslinger.io&lt;/a&gt; was available, he has to do something with it.
